# MCRA_CRoW_Features
.kml files listing features from the MCRA database that exist on CRoW land. CRoW Shapefiles used to construct these .kmls were taken from [Natural England Open Data](https://naturalengland-defra.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/crow-act-2000-access-layer), whilst the original MCRA .kmls used were taken from the [MCRA Cave Registry](http://www.mcra.org.uk/registry/registrysearch.php). To comply with the MCRA's license I declare that some modifications were made of the data, for example the deletion of cave descriptions.

The naming of the files is the MCRA convention - as such the most interesting file for most people will be [Caves100_in_CRoW.kml](https://github.com/aricooperdavis/MCRA_CRoW_Features/blob/master/Caves100_in_CRoW.kml), which lists the caves on CRoW land who's length is greater than 100m.

#### N.B. This may not include all MCRA features on CRoW land, and may mistakenly include some features that are not on CRoW land, as I cannot guarantee the accuracy/completeness of the MCRA and CRoW data that I'm using.
